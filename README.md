Under the hood, <PROJECTNAME> uses FFmpeg. Shout out to this open-source toolkit!

It is meant to be used as an alternative to services like Imgix that transcode videos. Though, <PROJECTNAME> doesn't store any media, it just processes them.

<PROJECTNAME> follows the Unix philosophy.

Main priorities are to keep the API simple, ergonomic and stable whilst adding support for new big formats (supported by browsers) regularly.

I mainly use this for my other project Galera but I'd like to make a frontend (client) for it in the future when I have more time.

PRs are welcome :).
